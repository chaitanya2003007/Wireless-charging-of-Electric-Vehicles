Magnetic flux is generated vertically from the ground when electricity 
passes through the Ground Transmission Unitâ€™s primary coil, which is 
installed on the surface of the parking place. Electrical pressure is 
generated by overlapping with the secondary coil in the Vehicle Receiver 
Unit in the vehicle, and electricity is supplied from the first coil to the 
second one (electromagnetic induction). The unique technology achieves 
a charging efficiency of 80-90%, equivalent to that of cable charging.
 
 System mainly has two sections, wireless power transmitter & a 
wireless power receiver sections. The transmitter section of the proposed 
system consists of a power source and a transmitter coil whereas the 
receiver section consists of a receiver coil, rectifier and filtering circuit, 
and a rechargeable battery. The AC power from the transformer is given 
to the primary coil which is implanted on the charging station. The flux is 
radiated out from the primary coil and this flux is linked with the 
secondary coil which induces current in the secondary coil in the EV. The 
alternating current induced in the secondary coil is converted to direct 
current which is then used to charge the battery of the EV
